# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain model

## Architecture — In the small

## Architecture of deployed application

## User activities

## Sequence of functionality/calls trough _Chirp!_

# Process

## Build, test, release, and deployment
### Versioning
Our project used "Calender Versioning" in the beginning, before we were introduced to semantic versioning.
The semantic versioning was later automated for our weekly releases, using [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) from Google.
Release Please continously looks at the commits pushed to the main branch, and updates a changelog on a separate branch.
This changelog can then be published along with our actual release. This was done for convienece, as we can continue to develop the project without worring about creating our own changelog.

### Deployment
Whenever we deploy our code to GitHub, a number of GitHub Actions scripts will be run. These can be found the .github/workflow directory.
- coverage.yml: Runs a code coverage test and fails upon not reaching the set threshold
- format.yml: Runs dotnet format, which maintains a certain code standard in our code. These formatting commits have been attributed to our group member natthias
- main_bdsagroup13chirprazor.yml: Builds and deploys our code to our Azure Webapp instance, using our GitHub Secrets to access login information. This file was auto-generated by Azure and afterwards customized for our needs by a group member.
- release.yml: Builds and publishes our project to our GitHub repository, with builds for different operating systems.

### Linear git history
This group has enforced linear git history on our project. This means that rather than merge different brances with each other, a Pull Request is instead created and upon approval from another group member, the branch is rebased first and then merged.
